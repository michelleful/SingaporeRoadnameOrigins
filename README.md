PyCon slides explaining the process of building the map: [http://michelleful.github.io/SingaporeRoadnameOrigins/#/](http://michelleful.github.io/SingaporeRoadnameOrigins/#/)

A series of blog posts explaining the map in even more detail: [http://michelleful.github.io/code-blog/2015/04/24/sgmap/](http://michelleful.github.io/code-blog/2015/04/24/sgmap/)

Notebooks: [http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/michelleful/SingaporeRoadnameOrigins/tree/master/notebooks/](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/michelleful/SingaporeRoadnameOrigins/tree/master/notebooks/) (The geography notebooks are the best documented. The machine learning notebooks are a bit messy.)

Want the final data? [Here it is.](https://github.com/michelleful/SingaporeRoadnameOrigins/blob/master/notebooks/singapore-roads-classified.geojson)
Spot a wrongly-classified road? Submit a pull request on the file - preferably with some kind of documentation if the error is not self-evident. Thanks! :)
