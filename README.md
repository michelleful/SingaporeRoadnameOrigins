SingaporeRoadnameOrigins
========================

A map of Singapore, with roads colour-coded for language of origin

Plan:
-----
[x] Get list of Singapore roadnames
[ ] Use scikit-learn to classify roadnames into languages of origin
    [x] Extract training features
    [ ] Experiment with various 
    [ ] Evaluate results
    [ ] Iteratively perform manual correction and expand the training set
[ ] Use OpenStreetMap and GeoJSON (?) to plot the map

Optional:
[ ] Use GeoDjango to produce interactive database
[ ] Compare roadnames in CBD to the Jackson town plan of 1822, which
    segregated races into different zones
[ ] Devise an evaluation metric to measure the homogeneity of roadnames
    within a certain area
[ ] Apply evaluation metric to data such as electoral constituency boundaries
    as they evolve over time
